                    <h1>Science Fiction</h1>
                    <p>Science fiction film is a film genre that uses science fiction: speculative, science-based
                        depictions of phenomena that are not necessarily accepted by mainstream science, such as
                        extraterrestrial life forms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception, and time travel, often along
                        with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, or other technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Science fiction
                        films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical
                        issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may

                        be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific
                        plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.</p>

                    <p>The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Melies' A Trip to the
                        Moon (1902) amazed audiences with its trick photography effects. The next major example in the
                        genre was the 1927 film Metropolis. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of
                        low-budget B-movies. After Stanley Kubrick's 1968 landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey, the science
                        fiction film genre was taken more seriously. In the late 1970s, </p>
